## Project Overview

This Data Analysis project emphasize to derive meaningful insight from the HR Data. By carefully analyzing the different parameters in this data to gather enough and adequate insight and observations to make a concise and reasonable decisions which then prompt us to tell a compelling and captivating stories around the data insights gotten and to know the performance from our data.

## Data Sources
The primary source of this Data that is used is HR Data that was given to us by our instructor .

## Tools Used
- Ms Excel for Fetching of data

- Microsoft Power Bi for cleaning of data and for reporting.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach in data analysis that involves summarizing and visualizing data to understand its main characteristics, uncover patterns, and identify potential relationships between variables such as;

- What is the Employee count in the organization?
- What is the sum of attrition in the organization?
- Which department experience more attrition?
- What education qualification experienes the most attrtion?
- what is the Rate of attrition in the organization?
  
## Power Bi Query Used

To find the Sum of Attrition, I used a conditional formatting to create a measure for the Attrition. The code is below;
```
If Attrition equals Yes then 1
Else
   0
```
To find the Current Employee, I created a Measure using the DAX function. The code is below;
```
SUM('HR data'[Employee Count])-SUM('HR data'[Attrition Count])
```
To find the Rate of Attrition, I created a Measure using the DAX function. The code is below;
```
SUM('HR data'[Attrition Count])/SUM('HR data'[Employee Count])
```


  ## Result 1
  ![DASH](https://github.com/Ellamina19/Data-Analysis-for-Skilharvest/blob/main/HR%20REPORT.jpg)
  From our Analysis, we derived the following insight:

-  The HR Employee count

- The Sum of Attrition

- The Sum of current Employee

- Rate of Attrition

- The Average age of Attrition

- Attrition count by Education

- Attrition By Department

- Attrition By Age and the Gender with the highest attrition

- Attrition Count By Education and Business Travel

  ## Findings
 - From our result, we can deduce the observations that in education sector, Bachelor's degree has the most highest number of attrition, But whyðŸ˜•, Myabe because they want to further their education to gain more degree or they got a bigger catch job than the one they currently have, who knows ðŸ˜•.
 -  We also observed that the department with the highest number of attrition is R&D department. Maybe they have much of retired workers or people that have stayed in the comany for years and the company decided to relieve them or maybe most of them in the R&D got a bigger catch and decided to leave the company.
